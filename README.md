Unofficial Yandex Music API client.

There's wonderful project written by MarshalX which I've used in python for a desktop player. Some workarounds with that package were needed at that time.
Some time ago, I wanted to transfer it to Golang and make some improvements, but I found another MarshalX port of MarshalX published by Igorprostoff. Thanks a lot!
So, Yandex music API client to be continued...
